FILL OUT THIS TEMPLATE, REMOVING/REPLACING ALL NON-BOLD TEXT WITH YOUR OWN INFORMATION.
BE AS CLEAR AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE.

ONCE ALL INFORMATION HERE HAS BEEN FILLED IN, THE MODULE WILL BE REVIEWED & DISCUSSED
BY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS AND BY THE COMMUNITY. IF IT IS APPROVED AS SOMETHING USEFUL/BENEFICIAL,
THEN IT IS GUARANTEED TO BE ADDED TO THE ENHANCER.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE AND CODE THIS YOURSELF, THAT'D BE AWESOME! JUST OPEN A
PULL REQUEST WHEN YOU'RE READY. IF PROGRAMMING ISN'T YOUR THING, ANOTHER DEV WILL COME
ALONG AND PICK THE IDEA UP.

ONCE SOMEONE STARTS WORK ON THIS, THE ISSUE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO THEIR GITHUB ACCOUNT
SO MULTIPLE PEOPLE DON'T ALL WORK ON THE SAME THING: IF YOU PLAN ON MAKING THIS, SAY SO!

**problem**

why is this feature necessary? how will it help? what existing shortcomings does it address?

**solution**

how will this feature appear/act?

how could this be technically implemented using the available
capabilities of the enhancer and notion?

**cons**

what are the potential costs or dangers of this feature, or things that may go
outside of the enhancer's scope? e.g. bad performance, security issues, or
modifying the data notion stores.

**alternatives**

would a different feature remove the need for this?

does this need to be implemented by the enhancer? could an external service work better?
e.g. playing background music via noisli or youtube.
